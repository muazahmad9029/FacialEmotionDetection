# FacialEmotionDetection
Our Facial Emotion Detection project harnesses the power of advanced technologies to identify and analyze facial expressions. This innovative system seamlessly integrates two essential components:

Face Detection with face_recognition Library:
We leverage the robust capabilities of the face_recognition library in Python to accurately detect human faces within images. By employing this library, we locate facial features and create precise bounding boxes around them. This initial step lays the foundation for our emotion recognition process.

Emotion Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):
To delve deeper into the emotions expressed on these detected faces, we implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Trained on a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, this CNN model has acquired the ability to classify facial features. By harnessing the power of deep learning, we analyze the subtle nuances of expressions, distinguishing emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, and more.

Through the seamless integration of face detection and emotion classification, our Facial Emotion Detection project offers a comprehensive solution for understanding human emotions in diverse contexts. Whether used for research, entertainment, or real-time applications, this project provides valuable insights into the intricate world of facial expressions.
